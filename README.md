A fresh Fedora installation doesn't come with adequate support for many essential features that FedoraQuick easily enables:
* Playing many media formats (including mp3).
* Installing popular software such as Chromium, VLC and more, directly from repositories.
* FreeType LCD font smoothing.
* ExFAT filesystem support.
* Other things.

Installing these crucial functionalities can be a pain for new users. People generally have to hunt down outdated answers on StackOverflow and piece together a way to make their Fedora desktop *work*.

FedoraQuick is a one-line command that takes care of everything you need to have a Fedora system that does more out of the box. It's always up to date, is safe, reliable and elegant.

**Warning**: FedoraQuick cannot function without requiring root access. Therefore, we strongly recommend you read the source code before running it on your machine.
